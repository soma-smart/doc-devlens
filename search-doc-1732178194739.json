The values.yaml file (or any other config Helm file you specifies) need to have two key so Devlens can find your secrets : namespace and secret.    The purpose of that functionnality is to substitut your local project environnement variables by their value stocked in kube secret.  For example if you need to be sure that a file only use one specific env for Database:  import os import spark test1=spark.table(&quot;PRD_DB_MET_BBBB.SC_PARAM_MET.TABLE1&quot;) test2=spark.table(os.getenv(&quot;DATABASE&quot;) + &quot;_DB_MET_BBBB.SC_PARAM_MET.TABLE2&quot;)   A basic Annotator could retreive the PRD from the first DB name but would not get the value of DATABASE.  That why we created a system that substitut os.getenv statement with their value holded in a kube secret.  That mean that Annotation will get the swapped values for you.  During the steps you will need to provide your project folder path, your deployement file path (usually your helm values.yaml file) and your kubeconfig path (usually located under ~/.kube/config) :    Now we can can query the DB to check swapped Values !

It searches for import statements, import names, and dotted names within the AST. Parameters: ----------- ast : ParserRuleContext The abstract syntax tree to be parsed for import statements. Yields: ------- Annotation An annotation object containing the name &quot;Import&quot;, the value of the import statement, and the context in which the import statement was found. &quot;&quot;&quot; importStmts = findAll(ast, &quot;Import_stmt&quot;) importNames = findAll(importStmts, &quot;Import_name&quot;) names = findAll(importNames, &quot;Dotted_name&quot;) for match in names: yield Annotation(name=&quot;Import&quot;, value=self.getText(match), context=match)   What interest us in this example is mostly the use of findAll() method. This method will create a list of every node you want in the AST.  You just have to use the findAll() on each node you want to filter until you get the value of the node.  The last part is to create an Annotation for each match you have. You can choose to not store a value in the Annotation by passing None to the annotation.
