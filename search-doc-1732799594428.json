Binaries in the release come with an 'annotators/' folder already filled with some examples.  Here is an example of the Annotator that will store every import of your project:  class PythonImportAnnotator(AbstractAnnotator): &quot;&quot;&quot; PythonImportAnnotator is an annotator class that identifies import statements in Python code. &quot;&quot;&quot; def parse(self, ast: ParserRuleContext): importStmts = findAll(ast, &quot;Import_stmt&quot;) importNames = findAll(importStmts, &quot;Import_name&quot;) names = findAll(importNames, &quot;Dotted_name&quot;) for match in names: yield Annotation(name=&quot;Import&quot;, value=self.getText(match), context=match)   What interests us in this example is mostly the use of the findAll() method. This method will create a list of every node you want in the AST.  You just have to use the findAll() on each node you want to filter until you get the value of the node.  Here is the AST that represent an import:  File_input └── Statements └── Statement └── Simple_stmts └── Simple_stmt └── Import_stmt └── Import_name └── 'import' └── Dotted_as_names └── Dotted_as_name └── Dotted_name └── 'dataiku' └── '   In the annotator we get every Dotted_name nested in every Import_name nested in every Import_stmt. Filtering this way make the annotator as much precise as possible, so it will not get another unrelated node.  The last part is to create an Annotation for each match you have. You can choose to not store a value in the Annotation by passing None to the annotation.  Executing a check will result in the creation of Annotations and the filling of the database.

The values.yaml file (or any other config Helm file you specify) needs to have two keys so Devlens can find your secrets: namespace and secret.  You will need a kubeconfig file and a helm deployment file.  # values.yaml namespace: devlens-cli secret: enabled: true ref: - secretRef: name: database   The purpose of this functionality is to substitute your local project environment variables with their values stored in Kubernetes secrets.  For example, if you need to ensure that a file only uses one specific environment variable for the Database:  import os import spark test1 = spark.table(&quot;PRD_DB_MET_BBBB.SC_PARAM_MET.TABLE1&quot;) test2 = spark.table(os.getenv(&quot;DATABASE&quot;) + &quot;_DB_MET_BBBB.SC_PARAM_MET.TABLE2&quot;)   A basic annotator could retrieve the PRD from the first DB name but would not get the value of DATABASE.  That's why we created a system that substitutes os.getenv statements with their values held in a Kubernetes secret.  This means that the annotation will get the swapped values for you.  During the steps, you will need to provide your project folder path, your deployment file path (usually your Helm values.yaml file), and your kubeconfig path (usually located under ~/.kube/config):    Now we can query the DB to check swapped values!
